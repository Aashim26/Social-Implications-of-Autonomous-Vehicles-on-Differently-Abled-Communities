## 🚗 Social Implications of Autonomous Vehicles on Differently-Abled Communities  

### 📖 Overview  
This repository explores how autonomous vehicles (AVs) can transform mobility for differently-abled communities. It highlights both opportunities and challenges, focusing on accessibility, inclusivity, and social impact. The project combines research, case studies, and data-driven insights to evaluate how AV technology can bridge mobility gaps and empower individuals with disabilities.  

### 🌍 Motivation  
Transportation barriers often limit independence and participation in society for differently-abled individuals. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to:  
- Enhance **independent mobility** without reliance on human drivers.  
- Improve **access to healthcare, education, and employment**.  
- Reduce **social isolation** by enabling easier travel.  
- Promote **inclusive urban design** and policy frameworks.  

### 📊 Key Features  
- Research notes on accessibility challenges in current transport systems.  
- Analysis of AV technology adoption and its impact on differently-abled communities.  
- Case studies linking AVs to **real-world social benefits**.  
- Visualizations and datasets highlighting accessibility metrics.  
- Policy recommendations for inclusive AV deployment.  

### 🧩 Use Cases  
- **Deaf-Blind Communication Support**: AV interfaces designed with multimodal feedback.  
- **Wheelchair Accessibility**: Vehicle design considerations for seamless entry/exit.  
- **Cognitive Assistance**: AI-driven navigation aids for individuals with cognitive impairments.  

### 📈 Future Directions  
- Integration of AVs with **IoT-enabled smart cities**.  
- Ethical frameworks for equitable access.  
- Simulation models to test accessibility scenarios.
